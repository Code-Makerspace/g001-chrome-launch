## Exercises

1. Exercise one is always going to be "do what I did in the video". There's value to be had in learning by imitation. So do that first.
2. You saw me add a domain to the DNS. Use your own domain (https://yourdomain.com) and add another "A" record to your DNS to add a different subdomain pointing to the same IP address as the main domain. Now access your site with the new subdomain (https://subdomain.yourdomain.com) and notice that it doesn't work. Why? Remember to add the new domain information to the domains tab in Dokploy for your site. Does it work now?
   a. Note: You may have to stop/start the site from the site's General tab in Dokploy to get the new domain to work.
